					<strong>Joe Rogan:</strong> Alright, folks, we’re live. Today, I’ve
					got an incredible guest, Dr. Jane Carter. She’s an evolutionary
					biologist who’s been studying the Amazon. Dr. Carter, thanks for being
					here.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Jane Carter:</strong> Thanks for having me, Joe. It’s been
					a fascinating experience, spending so much time in the Amazon. There’s
					so much we don’t know about that place, even though it’s been
					extensively studied.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Joe Rogan:</strong> Yeah, it’s crazy, right? I’ve heard that
					there are species out there that haven’t even been discovered yet. Do
					you think that’s true?
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Jane Carter:</strong> Absolutely. In fact, one of the most
					exciting things about working in the Amazon is the sheer number of
					undiscovered species. Every time we go out, we find new things. And
					the ecosystem is so rich—it’s constantly evolving.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Joe Rogan:</strong> That’s wild. It makes you think about how
					little we really know about the planet, right? I mean, we’ve got all
					this technology, but theres still so much left to explore.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dr. Jane Carter:</strong> Exactly. And there’s also the impact
					of deforestation and climate change. Those are real threats to these
					ecosystems. We’re seeing it firsthand as we work out there.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Joe Rogan:</strong> That’s something I worry about a lot. We
					talk about it on the podcast sometimes, but it always feels like
					there’s something more we could be doing.
